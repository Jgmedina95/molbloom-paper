# MolBloom-Paper Repository

Welcome to the MolBloom-Paper repository! This repository contains the code and documentation for our research paper on comparing different implementations of Bloom filters with various hashing variations and their time analysis in comparison to traditional internet search methods in datasets. Work based on the package [molbloom](https://github.com/whitead/molbloom.git).


## Introduction

This research paper focuses on two main aspects:

1. Studying various implementations of Bloom filters with different hashing variations.
2. Time analysis comparisons between Bloom filters and internet search on datasets.
Both aspects where done using the [COCONUT database](https://coconut.naturalproducts.net/).

The code in this repository is divided into two primary files for each respective aspect mentioned above.
